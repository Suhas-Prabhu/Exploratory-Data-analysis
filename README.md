Exploratory data analysis is the approach in which the data available is analyzed and investigated to see what data can reveal beyond the formal modeling or hypothesis testing task and summarize the main charecteristics, often using statistical graphs and employing data visualization methods.The statistical graphs and visualizations help to discover patterns,to spot anomalies,to test hypothesis and to check assumptions.

EDA is a crucial step before you jump to machine learning or modeling of your data. It gives insights on whether the selected features are good enough to model, are all the features required, are there any correlations based on which we can either go back to the Data Pre-processing step or move on to modeling.In every machine learning workflow, the last step is Reporting or Providing the insights and as a Data Scientist you can explain every bit of code but you need to keep in mind the audience. By completing the Exploratory Data Analysis you will have many plots, heat-maps, frequency distribution, graphs, correlation matrix along with the hypothesis by which any individual can understand what your data is all about and what insights you got from exploring your data set.

In this repository is a self paced collection of exploratory data analysis projects with a description of all the steps.Throughout this guideline you will walk through the details of projects  with a brief description
